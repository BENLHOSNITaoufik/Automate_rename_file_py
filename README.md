# Automate_rename_file_py

This code is about remane a set of files using python funcions and  libraries:
- firstly we need to create a function that we will reuse with translation of names of files through calling <code> bidi.algorithm </code> model 
- Then we will specify the folder that contains our files. To do that import  <code> os </code> lib, and passing the path as parameter to <code> os </code> method called <code> listdir </code>.
